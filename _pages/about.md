# About Me
I am currently a second-year postdoc in the [Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.csail.mit.edu/), at [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://www.mit.edu/). I received my Ph.D. degree in manufacturing engineering from [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/), Beijing, China, in 2018, and received my B.S. degree in automation engineering from [Harbin Engineering University](https://english.hrbeu.edu.cn/), Harbin, China, in 2012. My research interests include intelligent manufacturing, real-time scheduling, discrete system modeling and simulation, computer vision for transportation and medicine. During my PhD, I researched the real-time scheduling problem in cloud manufacturing environment and developed intelligent algorithms and dynamic data-driven simulation methods to improve system performance. At MIT, he develops machine learning and computer vision algorithms for multiple object tracking and medicine image analysis. I serve as one of the [chairs](https://pda.mit.edu/about/officers/) of the MIT Postdoc Association ([MIT PDA](https://pda.mit.edu/)) from 2019 to 2020, and serves in the editorial board of the International Journal of Modeling, Simulation, and Scientific Computing (IJMSSC), and serves as a reviewer for more than 20 academic journals. My awards and honors include the Beijing Municipal Education Commission Outstanding Graduate Award in 2018, and the China Simulation Society Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award in 2019.
